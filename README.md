# Savory

Savory solves a common issue, especially among college students, of what meals to make without buying excess ingredients. Savory uses a JSoup web-scraper to have real-time queries that can then be stored within a Google Sheets Database. The web scraper queries recipes based on a search performed by the results of the document scanner.
